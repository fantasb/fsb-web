	</div>

	<div class="sec">
		<h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
		<p>Please read these Terms of Use (the &quot;Terms&quot;) carefully because they are legally binding on you when you access the website ranktt.com (the &quot;Site&quot;). The term &quot;Site&quot; also includes all content and services available on Site. Site visitors are referred to herein as &quot;you&quot;; if you are visiting this Site on behalf of an entity or organization, &quot;you&quot; also means that entity or organization. The Site is owned and operated by WYD Agency LLC (&quot;WYD&quot; or &quot;we&quot;).</p>
		<p>BY ACCESSING OR USING ANY PART OF THE SITE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WAIVER OF CLASS-ACTION RIGHTS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE. IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ANY PROVISION OF THE TERMS OR OUR <a href="/privacy-policy">PRIVACY POLICY</a>, YOU MUST EXIT THE SITE.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sec">
		<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
		<p>To use the Site, you must be, and represent and warrant that you are, of legal age (18 years of age or older) and competence. If you use our Site, you are representing and warranting to us that you have full power and authority to enter into and comply with these Terms, and that these Terms are binding on you and enforceable against you.  By using the Site on behalf of any third party, you are representing and warranting to us that you are an authorized representative of that third party and that your use of the Site constitutes such third party's agreement to these Terms. You represent and warrant that your agreement to and compliance with these Terms does not and will not breach or conflict with any other agreement or arrangement you have with someone else or otherwise violate the law. In addition, if you have previously been prohibited from accessing the Site, you are not permitted to access the Site.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sec">
		<h2>3. Rankings</h2>
		<p>We rank software developers using a proprietary algorithm. However, on the Site we have disclosed some details about the factors and sources of information used to generate the rankings. For more information, please visit our <a href="/rubric">Algorithm Breakdown</a>. Our ranking of a software developer is not an endorsement of any particular software developer and is not a guarantee of the person's quality, competency or character. Our ranking of a software developer is not a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such person is involved. You should not rely solely on our ranking in deciding whether to contact, hire or engage any given software developer.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sec">
		<h2>4. Information On The Site</h2>
		<p>Our Site displays information not created or developed by WYD (such as information posted by software developers). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. However, we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published on our Site. We cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sec">
		<h2>5. Facilitation Services</h2>
		<p>You may request that we contact a software developer. If you do so, we may contact the software developer for you and charge you a service fee for such facilitation. We will not charge you a service fee without your express acceptance of the fee. Additionally, we may require that you enter into other terms and conditions prior to performing facilitation services for you. For example, prior to contacting a software developer, we may require that you agree to pay us a percentage of the fees paid to the software developer if you engage that person. However, we are not the employer or staffing agency of any software developerâ€”we are an intermediately only. We do not make any representation, warranty, promise or guarantee regarding any software developer. You agree that WYD cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or services provided by software developers you connect with via the Site. You will defend and indemnify us from any claim by a software developer that you failed to pay that software developer or fulfill any other obligation to that software developer.</p>

	<div class="sec">
		<h2>Disputes</h2>
		<p><span class="tos-subsec-number">20.1</span><span class="tos-subsec-title">Informal Resolution.</span> If you have any dispute with WYD, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact WYD at legal@ranktt.com, provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information, and allow 60 days to pass, during which the parties will attempt to reach an amicable resolution of any issue.</p>
		<p><span class="tos-subsec-number">20.2</span><span class="tos-subsec-title">Arbitration.</span> These Terms and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the United States Arbitration Act applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings.  Any claims arising out of, relating to or connected with these Terms must be asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Terms and the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (including the use of desk, phone or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs of travel). One arbitrator will conduct the arbitration. The arbitrator will not conduct any form of class or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable or a particular claim is subject to arbitration.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  There are only two exceptions to this arbitration agreement:</p>
		<ul class="legal-selfnumbered">
			<li>a. First, if WYD reasonably believes that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate these Terms, WYD may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. You understand and agree that your breach of these Terms will cause WYD irreparable harm for which recovery of money damages would be impracticable to ascertain and inadequate, and that WYD will therefore be entitled to obtain timely injunctive relief, without the need to post a bond or prove actual monetary damages, to protect WYD's rights under these Terms in addition to any and all remedies available at law.</li>
			<li>b. Second, any claim of $1,000 or less may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small claims court in Los Angeles, California, if the claim and the parties are within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="tos-subsec-number">20.3</span><span class="tos-subsec-title">WAIVER OF COURT TRIAL AND CLASS ACTION RIGHTS.</span>  BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A COURT TRIAL (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE) OR TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING FILED AGAINST WYD OR ANY OTHER WYD PARTY.</p>
		<p><span class="tos-subsec-number">20.4</span><span class="tos-subsec-title">LIMITATION ON TIME TO FILE CLAIMS.</span>  REGARDLESS OF ANY LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR THESE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sec">
		<h2>21.	Copyright Infringement Claims</h2>
		<p>We may remove, suspend, terminate access or take other appropriate action against repeat offenders. We may also remove content that, in our sole discretion, appears to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If you have evidence, know or have a good faith belief that content on or available through the Site infringes a copyright which you own or for which you are a designated agent, please send a notice to us in accordance with the <a href="/copyright-infringement">Copyright Infringement Claims Procedures</a>.</p>
